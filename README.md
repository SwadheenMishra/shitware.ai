# shitware.ai: We're in your walls, and so are you in ours...

## Are you tired of spyware companies that just aren't... *there* enough for you?

Then welcome to **shitware.ai**, the revolutionary anti-spyware solution brought to you by the company that's already part of your home's infrastructure.

**We're in your walls.**  Literally and figuratively.  And you know what?  You're kind of in ours too now.  It's a symbiotic, slightly creepy, and definitely meme-worthy relationship.
